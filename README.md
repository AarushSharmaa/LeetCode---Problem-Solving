## A collection of my LeetCode solutions

### The above image represents flow of thoughts whenever I encounter a problem :)

Anyways, so this may be useful for anyone who is trying to build their problem solving abilities by practising **Data Structures and Algorithms**. Feel free to reach out for discussion on any topic or solution.
You may find a lot of solutions that are not optimal but starts from the fundamentals. I believe that for the **completeness** of a solution, understanding a naive approach and then moving to an optimal approach is really helpful to build intuition.
