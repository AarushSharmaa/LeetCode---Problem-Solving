Hi Everyone, This may be useful for anyone who are trying to build their problem solving abilities by practising **Data Structures and Algorithms**. Feel free to reach out for discussion on any topic.
I have been trying to optimise some problems as well, but you will find a lot of problems that are not optimal but starts from the fundamentals. I think for a completeness of a solution, understanding a naive approach and then moving to an optimal approach is really helpful.
