### Hi Everyone, This is a collection of LeetCode problems, which are directly imported from the site as I solve them. 

This may be useful for anyone who is trying to build their problem solving abilities by practising **Data Structures and Algorithms**. Feel free to reach out for discussion on any topic or solution.
You will find a lot of problems that are not optimal but starts from the fundamentals. I believe that for a **completeness** of a solution, understanding a naive approach and then moving to an optimal approach is really helpful.
